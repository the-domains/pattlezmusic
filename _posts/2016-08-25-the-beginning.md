# The Beginning

It's crazy how things go. It's about nearly a year since we set this plan into motion, and now, here we are! \#Progress If only we were able to launch things off a year ago, but everything happens for a reason. Or so I'd like to believe, anyway. I still remember like it was only yesterday...

Okay, so some backstory for those who don't know. My name is Patrick Shaw. Otherwise known as Pattlez. I'm currently 23 years old, living in Winnipeg (or Winterpeg, Murderpeg, Pothole City or Construction Land), and I'm an aspiring Hip-Hop Recording Artist and budding producer/beatmaker. I've been rapping for about six years now and producing for five. Not exactly an upstart, but in the grand scheme of things, I'm still pretty new to it all. 

One person I have to give credit to is my close friend (who we will decide to call) ReDGE. He's the one who actually found out about this whole Grid idea, and jumped on it immediately. I met him back in early 2009, and we've been cool ever since (with some rough patches along the way, but any close friendship is bound to have a few of them). 

But you know, for a guy who's waifu-obsessed (for those anime fans out there) and about as random as a game of Minesweeper (Dear God, I hope I got that example right...), he's a pretty reliable guy. 

But anyway. How this originally came up was, I had an idea that I could involve all of my friends in. It would've basically been a team of people coming together to make content for a YouTube channel. We called it, "The Exchange Junction". Everybody had their own thing and had their own ideas to contribute to, but unfortunately... Things didn't end up the way we expected it to be. There were a ton of scheduling conflicts, and a lack of drive throughout the group, so the idea ended up dying. However, the one thing that didn't die... Was this very website idea. So I suppose in way, by me using this, The Exchange Junction will live on. And who knows? Maybe one day, I'll find a way to revive it and maybe make it something great. Everything has its time and place, and maybe it just wasn't the right time. We'll see what the future holds. 

Here we are, though. One year later. It's currently 3:02 AM and on my first cup of coffee. I have high hopes for this new place. I think I could really learn to appreciate what goes on here and use it to my advantage, instead of flooding my Facebook feed with my rambling thoughts (which I know you all love reading, don't you lie to me, now...) and music links. I'm excited. Even though I've taken music sort of seriously, I guess with this site... I can kinda say that it's for real now. It's both exciting and scary, because who knows what the future holds? Hopefully, everything I've wished and dreamed of, and more. Only one way to find out... And that's to go see it for myself. 

Let's go.
